## Are you Tired of slow animation of dock in Mac?

#### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Prerequisite
first make sure `Automatically hide and show the Dock` is toggled on in <br>settings -> desktop and dock 
#### ü§ñ Command
To set the macOS Dock to hide and show instantly, execute the following command in your Terminal:
```
defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0; defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0; killall Dock
```
#### üìÑ Explanation:

`defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier -int 0`

‚Ä¢ This command sets the animation duration for showing or hiding the Dock to 0 seconds, making it appear or disappear instantly.

`defaults write com.apple.dock autohide-delay -float 0`

‚Ä¢ This command removes the delay before the Dock starts hiding after your cursor moves away, making the hiding action immediate.

`killall Dock`

‚Ä¢ This command restarts the Dock, applying the changes immediately.
#### ‚Ü©Ô∏è Reverting to Default behavior
If you decide to revert the Dock to its default settings, use the following command:
```
defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-time-modifier; defaults delete com.apple.dock autohide-delay; killall Dock
```
